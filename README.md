## Gameplan

Gameplan is an async-first discussions tool for remote teams. It encourages thoughtful communication and deep-thinking.

## Motivation
We've been remote first since day one, but as our team grew, chat tools like Telegram fell short. Missing out on crucial conversations became a major issue. We needed a better way to keep everyone connected and in sync. That's how Gameplan was born - to solve the problems of modern remote work!

## Key Features
- **Thread-first discussions**: Gameplan lets you start a discussion and have people comment on it at their own pace, encouraging thoughtful conversation and deep thinking. No more feeling obligated to be online all the time.

- **Spaces for organization**: Spaces help you categorize conversations by project, team, client, or topic – whatever makes sense for your team's workflow. This keeps discussions tidy and easy to find.

- **Customizable profiles**: Get a better picture of who's on your team with profiles that let everyone showcase their personality: cover images, short bios, and profile pictures.

- **Pages for note-taking**: Use pages as digital notes to jot down meeting minutes, proposals, ideas – whatever sparks creativity! They can be private by default or shared with just your team or specific spaces.

## Under the hood

### Backend
- [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework written in Python and Javascript. The framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.

- [Frappe UI](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface. The Frappe UI library provides a variety of components that can be used to build single-page applications on top of the Frappe Framework.

- [Redisearch](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch): A powerful text search and secondary indexing engine built on top of Redis. It powers Gameplan's fast search capabilities.

## Production setup
### Managed Hosting

You can try [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple, user-friendly and sophisticated [open-source](https://github.com/frappe/press) platform to host Frappe applications.

It takes care of installation, setup, upgrades, monitoring, maintenance and support of your Frappe deployments. It is a fully featured developer platform with an ability to manage and control multiple Frappe deployments.

## Development setup
### Docker
You need Docker, docker-compose and git setup on your machine. Refer [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). After that, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/frappe/gameplan
cd gameplan/docker
docker-compose up
```

Wait for sometime until the setup script creates a site. After that you can
access `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and Gameplan's login screen
should show up.

Use the following credentials to log in:

- Username: `alex@example.com`
- Password: `123`

### Local

Currently, this app depends on the `develop` branch of [frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe).

1. Setup frappe-bench by following [this guide](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/installation)
1. In the frappe-bench directory, run `bench start` and keep it running. Open a new terminal session and cd into `frappe-bench` directory.
1. Run the following commands:
    ```sh
    bench new-site gameplan.test
    bench get-app gameplan
    bench --site gameplan.test install-app gameplan
    bench --site gameplan.test add-to-hosts
    bench --site gameplan.test browse --user Administrator
    ```
 1. Now, open a new terminal session and cd into `frappe-bench/apps/gameplan`, and run the following commands:
    ```
    yarn
    yarn dev
    ```
 1. Now, you can access the site on vite dev server at `http://gameplan.test:8080`
